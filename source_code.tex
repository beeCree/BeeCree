\subsection{Executing the source code}
Before explaining the code, we will start with the way executing the source code.\\
First, select all in "data\_train.csv" and shift the contents downwards for 1 blocks, and write 1, 2, .... , 22 and "price" on the file's first row. \\
Do the same work for "data\_test.csv"\\
The file "data\_train.csv" and "data\_train.csv" should be in the same directory that "project.py" is in.\\
Second, open command-line and change directory where the py file is installed. \\
Third, type "python project.py data\_train.csv n non n n n" on command-line. It runs the program with the unique method\\
Fourth, type "python project.py data\_train.csv n non n n n" on command-line. It runs the program with the base method\\
It makes 2 files inside ./bin, "return.csv", which containing results of the prediction, and "runtime.txt", which contains console output.\\
